Optimization Approach:
1. Pushing selection.
2. Join Ordering. Sort the join predicates based on the product of the join table size. Go through the sorted predicates and join the tables that allows join.
3. General selection that only can be done after join.
4. Projection.

Roles of each member:
Do the project together.
